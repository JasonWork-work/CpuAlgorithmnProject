# CpuAlgorithmnProject
The program that i worked on is the cpualgorithm project is a program where u simulate on how cpu algorithms(FCFS,SJF,SRTF,RR,MLFQ) work.

The maximum numbers for the process is 10
The container for arrival and burst time are stored for each processes
The time quantums text fields will only unfadeds if the user picks a specific algorithm in the comboBox which is RR(Round robin) for time slice and allotment and MLFQ for priority
          

For this program, you need to input the processes, burst and arrival times individually. For example when you type on the process ID 1 and then burst: 14, arrival: 20, so you have to click input button to store the input variables in the metrics
